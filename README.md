# Remote-Sensing-Project
Using JavaScript in Google Earth Engine to Quantify Water Cover Area Change Following a Dam's Construction

This project uses remotely sensed data to quantify the change in water cover area (m^2), following the construction 
of the Alta Dam in Alta, Norway. 
The change in water cover area is visualised on the Google Earth Engine map - red pixels represent seasonal water cover change,
dark blue pixels represent new water cover, and light green pixels represent areas with no water. 
The frequency of each of the three types of water cover both before and after the dam's construction are visualised in histograms. 
The area covered by each of the three types of water cover, in metres squared, is calculated and presented. 
The total water cover area and the change in each of the water cover types before and after the dam's construction are calculated, 
and are presented in a table, and pie chart.
